# Competitive Programming 
## About
You can find here my implementation of multiple coding problems, algorithms and data structures.

## Organization
- [CSES Problem Set](/CSES): My solutions to the [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) problem set.
- [Contests](/Contests): A list of all contests I participated in. This includes virtual participations in official ICPC contests as well as contests on online platforms such as [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) or [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/).
- [Pre-Written Algorithms](/Pre-Written%20Algorithms): My implementation (in C++) of various common algorithms and data structures used for competitive programming.
- [Problems by Topics](/Problems%20by%20Topics): A selection of problems solved organized by specific topics.
